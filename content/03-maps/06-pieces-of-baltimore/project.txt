Text: Collaboration with Carey Chiaia. 

This is a jigsaw puzzle of all the neighborhoods in Baltimore City. There are 2 versions of this puzzle: one 4'x4' version you can draw on and an 18"x24" version that is laser cut.

This project owes a lot to, among others, Dan D'Oca and Brian Garner. But especially them.
