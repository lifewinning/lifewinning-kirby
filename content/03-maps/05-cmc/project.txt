Text: The Center for Missed Connections is an art project disguised as a think tank dedicated to the study of loneliness in cities, using the Missed Connections section of Craigslist as its primary data source. 

The project began kind of as a one-off joke and then it sort of spiraled out of control and I spent 2 years of my life doing work around it. Included on this page are projects from the CMC produced for art subscription quarterly The Present Group, online at <a href="http://centerformissedconnections.info">centerformissedconnections.info</a>, and as part of an exhibition at the Pratt Manhattan Gallery in 2010. 

The Center for Missed Connections owes its existence to the support of Naomi Miller and Katarina Jerenic's The Work Office, The Present Group, the Conflux Festival, and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council.
