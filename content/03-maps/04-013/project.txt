Text: For a day of action against austerity, we wanted to pay a visit to the residence of a particularly not-so-nice megabanker. The residence had a really nice courtyard out front, and we didn't want the cops to close it off, so we handed out this map a few minutes before sending people to the location. The icons used for the different locations were a code! People love codes.
