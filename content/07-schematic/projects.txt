Title: Schematic Quarterly

Text: Schematic Quarterly is a publication I started with Kimmy Fung in 2010. It's been on hiatus for a while, but I would love to work on it again. Get in touch if you have ideas for projects for it. More info can be found at (link:http://schematicquarterly.info text:schematicquarterly.info).
