For a few years I've served as a diplomatic liaison to the nation, arranging cultural events and assisting in the maintenance of a temporary consulate general in New York City. I have been to Zaqistan 3 times.  

In 2010, I helped design and fabricated these informational landmark signs and a welcome sign. I also fabricated the official flag of Zaqistan.
