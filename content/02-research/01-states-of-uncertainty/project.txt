When: 2011-ongoing

Text: Throughout the world there are a number of places that aren't included on standard political maps but that continue to function as political entities. They hold elections, use currencies, run factoriesâ€”and, technically, don't exist. These breakaway states, micro-nation projects, and ostensibly autonomous regions form out of civil wars, colonial rule, deeply entrenched ethnonationalist enmities, and, on occasion, simply because of the strong-headedness of the individuals who desire independence. The unrecognized state is a place of uneasy suspension, revealing nationhood to be not a fixed position but a place in a perpetual process of becoming. 

These are images from an installation at Space 1026 in Philadelphia, PA, in 2012. I'm currently working on a book based on this research.
