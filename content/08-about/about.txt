#Hello!

This is the part of making a portfolio website that is my least favorite. I never know what to say. 

My background is mostly in stories. Right now I do a lot of research-intensive projects that later become writing, maps, and data visualizations.

I live and work on a small island off the coast of America. I like to work with people working on interesting things, especially things where I get to learn new things and meet new people. Please get in touch!
