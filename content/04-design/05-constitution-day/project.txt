Text: Constitution Day is an annual panel talk organized by the (link:http://mica.edu text:Maryland Institute College of Art) and the (link:http://www.aclu-md.org/ text: ACLU of Maryland). It brings together a voice from the art world, a voice from academia or activism, and a voice from media or journalism to have a conversation about a topical political issue as it pertains to the U.S. Constitution. 

As a student, I volunteered to help coordinate the event. After I graduated, they kept asking me to help. Since 2010 I've had a more direct role in the selection and inviting of panelists. I also get to make the posters and program. It's really fun. I kind of love that a weird event like this can exist at MICA. 

Past speakers have included Sharon Hayes, Dan Savage, Kendall Thomas, Trevor Paglen, Lize Mogel, Lisa Fithian, and Cornel West.
