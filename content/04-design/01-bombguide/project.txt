Text: This is a map of downtown Manhattan galleries maintained by Bomb Magazine. Pink markers are galleries they really, really want you to check out. The others are good too though. 

Built using mapbox.js (0.6.4, which is old, but guys you still don't have easing in 1.0) and a Google Docs plugin also by Mapbox. Repo (link:https://github.com/lifewinning/bombmap/tree/gh-pages text:here).
